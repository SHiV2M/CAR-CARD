            <div class="card-title">MERCEDES GLS600</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                If you're winning the game of capitalism then an ultra-luxurious SUV like the 2024 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600 might just appear on your new-car shopping list in place of models that are merely luxurious, like the Benz-branded GLS on which the Maybach is based. The difference between the two can be summed up with one word: opulence. Every inch of the GLS600's interior has been optimized for comfort and richness. The GLS's third row has been ditched here in favor of a four-seat layout with miles of legroom for rear-seat passengers. This SUV is meant for chauffeur duty because you're almost certainly far too busy running your empire to distract yourself with driving. The GLS600 is priced for exclusivity too, so you're unlikely to suffer something as gauche as pulling up behind another one at the valet stand, unless, of course, you've purchased a matching set. After all, if you can afford one GLS600, it's likely a second one isn't too hard on the budget.
